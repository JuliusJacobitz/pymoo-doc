**September 12, 2021:** After quite some time, a bigger release of pymoo (version **0.5.0**) is available.
The project has made significant progress regarding its structure and has an entirely new module organization.
Even though there might be some breaking changes for users, it shall improve the clarity and readability of code in the long term. The documentation has gotten a completely new design and become responsive. In addition, some more algorithms have been improved (PSO, DE) and added (AGEMOEA, ES, SRES, ISRES). For more details, please have a look at the changelogs.

**September 4, 2020:** We are more than happy to announce that a new version of pymoo (version **0.4.2**) is available. This version
has some new features and evolutionary operators, as well as an improved getting, started guide.
For more details, please have a look at the release notes.

**May 4, 2020:** A new release of pymoo is available. Version **0.4.1** of our framework contains
a novel method to generate an arbitrary number of reference directions. Reference directions are
required to run most of the many-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGA3 or MOEAD.
Moreover, we have fixed minor bugs and provide a basic implementation of the well-known Hooke and Jeeves Pattern Search
algorithm for single-objective problems.
